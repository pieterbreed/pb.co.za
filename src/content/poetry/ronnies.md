wings ([she wrote this piece](/prosa/2014/11/26/spoken-word.html)) influenced my thinking
about sentence construction quite a lot. This is an initial experiment
in 'spoken' poetry.

    A pretty bar lady greets me as i walk in
    and asks me where I'm from
    my CA number plates makes her eyebrow rise
    when i answer "i don't know."
    
    The route through my hart
    passes here by Ronnie's shop
    and I'm on a road that my head insists
    is not going anywhere yet.
    
    The dry heat of the karoo shimmers in the distance and makes the top
    if the mountains fuzzy and the coke
    just does not seem to wash away the taste of disappointment in the
    back of my throat.
    
    A big rig shakes the shop as it rumbles by
    and a fly angrily buzzes around my head.
    Equally angry i swipe at it while i contemplate
    how to swipe my problems away too.
    
    Listen to me! How vain, how silly,
    how stupid to complain.
    The problems of a healthy man
    are not so great at all!
    
    But "be kind to yourself" she says
    wise and intuitive beyond how long we've been together
    not even present, this one
    but with me none the less.
    
    Little feathery wisps toy with a deep blue sky
    here where i'm passing through
    and finding little broken off bits i left
    long and far behind.
    
    The clouds clearly roil over to the south
    trying to climb a whole mountain range.
    Little tendrils crawl over greedily but is broken up quickly.
    I'm glad i didn't take that route.
    
    As i pay my bill the barlady winks at me
    her eyes alive.
    "You were wonderful with me"
    I say too quietly. "You too"
    she answers conspiratorially.
    
    I get back in my car and the needle falls off on the right
    on this dry, empty karoo road.
    The flight is pushing me and the chase is pulling me and
    I'm just too happy to oblige.
    
    A rock balad is needling me and suddenly,
    near a dusty collection of buildings
    I break out and I sing!
    I sing the shared sorrow, the feeling, the pain and the joy.
    
    Another man's love poem's love all too real in me
    and awakened by the red thunderclap I'm falling in love with.
    "It's a choice" i hear the wisdom repeated,
    and i choose this. I choose Her.
    
    I stop again for the demands of nature
    and bend down and scoop up a handful of this red earth.
    It trickles through my fingers and I think of the time we have left.
    Not so much. But enough. More than enough.
    
    I breathe deeply of the quiet stillness,
    I taste a phantom cigarette in my mouth.
    This dusty, bumpy little road
    shook off a lot that has lain covered for too long.
    
    I enter Cape Town a relaxed man and texts:
    "I'm home. I look forward to seeing you tonight"
    "Me too" she answers.
    I know, I think.
