    The filaments of my mind
    quest out to reach for words
    to pluck them from the mist
    from the fog that is my subconscious.
    
    They look like fingers
    and i fancy them to
    rest on each word to find its feel
    to decide, to ponder, to steal
    
    meaning from mist, i must
    find the right words
    and once i do
    i can revel in the beautiful lust
    
    of the synesthetic thrust
    of sound i hear when i can
    assemble them into a crisp waterfall
    of colour, like fingers, caressing a harp.
