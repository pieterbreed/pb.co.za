    Dreams, my companions, over so many sleepless nights
    where were you? I've missed your sounds and your sights,
    of laughter and of hapiness, of children running around
    of little feet and wooden floors making syncopated sounds.

    You've changed, the siren call still there, still strong
    but the timbre of your voice belonging now to a red-head's tongue.
    The daughter's hair bouncing wildly in flight
    and her little, red, mop of hair a secret, heart-stop of delight.

    It's hard waking up to find the dream still far
    and the fake memories tingling in the north sky, like a star.
    All of this is running away with me
    triggered by what your eyes had let me see.

    Reel it back (for now) and take it slow.
    The dream is still safe, this time it's in escrow.
