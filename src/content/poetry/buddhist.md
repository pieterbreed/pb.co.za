    The decent into stillness comes as a surprise
    the road to heaven still bumpy and across the rise
    i see the journey laid out on the flat plain
    realising my hope for a simple story finds itself slain.
    
    Self love, acceptance, the fat, smiling idiot preaches
    with a face cast in molten yellow, my heart defiantly reached
    but subverted from inside out
    I smile, having become the idiot myself and feeling like a lout.
    
    What are you resisting every day in your life?
    To which questions will you get answers from a wife?
    Have you found the pain at the heart of attachment?
    Have you figured out why you love like motherly bereavement?
    
    Drifting weightless in a sea of being, his fear finally sheathed
    he settles into this gentle rest on air long since breathed,
    the conductor tired up in his imagination
    with experiences of herbal self dilution.
    
    At peace with the world and with himself
    he opens his eyes and looks with his soul at himself,
    and as i become me again
    I'm happy to be in love again.
