    I've started listening to the blues;
    my eyes are picking up hues
    of incandescence
    in the cracks and crevices,
    where the music theory bows away
    to this rhythm and this sway;
    in places where my mind conspire
    twisting my attention, making me higher
    winding me up, turning me tight
    in my heart where it's hidden from sight.
    You have never seen
    the journey on which my heart has been
    and i don't know how to forget
    your face that's set
    against the backdrop of my story, so far,
    all i can do is sit and wonder in my car.
    The blues are teasing me, wildly
    pulling me around a siding
    in the road. My feet itch
    while my common sense glitch
    on your smile; right foot down
    and the speed camera struggles to earn a frown
    as i speed back to work for now.
    I can't think, I'm stuck. Wow!
    In my car the volume is pushed to the top
    and still your smile won't stop.
