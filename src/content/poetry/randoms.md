A friend sent these to me. Unfortunately I don't know attribution.

      Too much
	    me
	too little
	   you.

and this one:

    Take it all away,
	tear it and scatter yourself
	into the breeze around me
	and haunt me
	with the pieces I cannot catch.
	Hear me,
	as you shred yourself
	like confetti
	that never found its
	celebration,
	hear me:
	I
	would love the scraps
	of you.
