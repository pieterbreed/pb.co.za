    For a few months some time ago
    your laugh played songs in my head, and oh
    what a beautiful thing it was today
    when you came and said hi, let's play

    like we used to, with words, it's subtle,
    I'd present a joke, and you, a rebuttal.
    I had so much fun, I nearly cried,
    to pretend I'm not at all in love, I lied.

    In love with your smile, in love with your laugh,
    with the way your eyes played with my heart.
    You're a woman happily married to a man, not me,
    and I wishing, for a moment, to be he.

    But the love I have for you, my friend, it's dear
    that you represent the light, and not the darkness I fear.
    For I need you out there, laughing, my muse,
    so I can look forward to the future as I'm paying my dues.
