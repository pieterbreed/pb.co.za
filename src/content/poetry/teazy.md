Hierdie is deur 'n vriendin van my geskryf:

    I picture your soul when I'm dreaming,
    as a shelf of bottles, gleaming;

    The light fills and refracts,
    I can see colours in the cracks.

    Some empty, some not;
    Memories kept and some forgot.

    A beautiful noise, a soft echo lingers
    as I tap them with my fingers.
