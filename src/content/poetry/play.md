    Lets take the sun tight by its roots
    and shake its way 'cross the sky.
    Let's pluck the moon's silver boots
    and leave a reason why.
    
    Let's go do this crazy thing
    and play a show for them
    so all the stupid men can see
    i'm just not one of them
    
    Tap me a reason why
    i like to hear you sing
    the humming sound comforts me
    but maybe that's just you darling
    
    the sound drifts above the flow
    the kibble kabble base
    my mind likes to go there now
    and undress my world with grace
