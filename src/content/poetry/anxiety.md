    There is a rodent in my soul
	it scratches
	against the walls of my heart
	in the middle of the night
	at work when I'm alone
	right now.

    I can't talk to it
	I can't reason with it
	I can't convince it to fucking stop
	I can take it
	I can accept it

    That little shit is relentless
	it finds a way
	to find me
	my insides are raw
	why won't you help me stop it???
