there's so much more to you and I  
there's more to that which meets the eye and why am I so surprised  
that you too were wearing your disguise  
who knew that you are more than just â€¦  
_just_  
how can I say _just_?  
when I knew all along that there was more to you than meets the eye  
and why does it scare me and yet it does not  
the fact that what you hid was words and thoughts and rhythm and rhyme  
why did I think in a weird way that those are just mine to hide  
and now that I can peak inside  
how wide will you open up and  
how wide will I give you in return  
there's so much more than meets the eye  
there's so much more to you and I  
then why did it make me cry as I read what you wrote  
and how do you go back from pulling back the skin  
how do you go back once you're in that deep  
and yet I know that I will keep that safe  
and so will you  
because you know that that which meets beyond the eye  
where heart and soul collide that is the deepest thing we hide and  
that our souls keep safe  
and sometimes safe and sealed inside a Heart and that's the part that  
scares me most
