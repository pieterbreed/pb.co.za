    Where is your anger, where is your lust
    where is the pain you described,
    where is your fear and your worry,
    the denial and the broken trust?
    
    Where is your hand, where is your call
    to phone up a friend,
    to hang up your worry
    and to tear down a wall?
    
    Where is your bravery now
    as you hesitate to step in the sun
    to feel it's warmth
    and to be on the run?
    
    Where is that quiet determination
    so flamboyantly shown
    where is your force and your will
    carved from rough hewn stone?
    
    The question eating at your soul
    won't go away, they never do.
    They thrive on your fear
    and jump on you too.
