    the night was chance met
    and yet
    I relish the smell of oak
    and old cigars that wept
    the tears of years and years

    my eyes gets pulled
    towards a sunset
    that breaks for ever
    over your hand is it sweeps
    a breaker of rolling red thunder

    my soul is fixed
    as I stare and stare
    where
    I used to have a care
    for such things. this love.

    this joy, this grace, this spice
    I wept, for dreams, for fears of years
    and years
    your poise calms me down
    and pulls my mental gaze up, I'm dazed.

    chliches chase my up and down
    accross my frown
    but Jesus! Christ!
    your eyes were huge
    and I loved it, right there. right then.

    I loved how shy you were
    right then, right there
    where
    you looked away and silently smiled
    as you shared

    a story humbly yours
    important as life
    but in your eyes
    the hope that
    for me, it would intrigue

    Your trust was vulnerable
    and beautiful
    and a treasure,
    my treasure,
    to be carefully stored

    and wrapped in caring
    I prepare these words
    in anticipation of finding in you
    again the caring, the searching
    the reaching invitation to a walk in a garden
