title: "My World"
---

It has come to my attention that an account needs to be written.

I am talking about the "everything". The state of things as we know it. 

(`I want to say "humans" here instead of "we", but I'm worried that I blindside myself and somehow exclude somebody. This is not my intent. I mean everyone, that you think is included with "we".`)

Take a step back with me, please. I am going to try and talk to you. Directly. You, just now, reading these very words. Please humour me for a minute. 

I want you to close your eyes. (`please, I want you to actually read these next few words in the intro and then actually do it...`) 

 1. Take a deep breath. 
 1. Take another one. 
 1. Open your eyes.
 1. Observe that you are alive.
 1. Observe that right now, you are in a position where you are privileged enough to: 
    - sit still for a minute and 
    - take a break and
    - hear, read, feel, smell or taste, in some way or form, "sense" that what I'm about to write down.
    
 1. done
 1. `OK now actually do this, please :)`
 
Realize that your basic needs have been successfully met by the society that you live in. You've "made" it. You are the embodiment of the best that your society has been able to afford you. You are the top-point of your society. Well done! I, as one human to another, say this with not a hint of sarcasm. Well done. I am proud of you.

(`Maybe later I will be reminded to write down why I mean that to be true, even when you are very, very poor. I say this truly without irony.`)

Now. Take a step back with me. Let's look at how we, as a species, are doing.

And if I may be so forward. Just for 5 minutes. Just for the rest of this introduction, please humour me with the following:

 - Just be honest with yourself. 
 - Realize that you don't have to discuss anything in here with anybody if you don't want to.
 - Realize that I respect you to make up your own mind. I am not trying to change what you think. I am not going to try and tell you what to do, who to be or who to be with. Please, you do what you want to.
 - Realize, that I respect you enough to want to deal with you as an equal.
 - Realize, that just for a moment, you are going to have to respect me the same amount, for this to mean anything to either of us.
 - Just be honest with yourself. 

I am going to point some things out to you, in a sequence that makes sense to me, now, as I sit here. I think these things, if properly framed, can teach all of us. The point of these lessons are to be "better". I want to show you the things I've seen, because they were beautiful to me. This is my objective, just to share my world with you. My world is beautiful to me, I am in love with living in it and I would like to share that with you, so that maybe you will enjoy the story. OK?

So. I am going to tell you a story. Your story. The one of your society and the one of your race and of your species. I am going to base this purely on the things that I know you and I share. From there I am going to build out a little and invite you to go along with me, as far as you want.

```
BTW - You may stop right here if this is boring. But if you go on any further, realize that I know you are reading this because you want to. I am going to count on that, so be honest here. If this feels like too much work, all this reading all this nonsense, then really, stop reading right now, you!

If you're still here then you are reading this because you want to.
```

Aside: Notation (if this is not clear already)

```
This is what I want to use when I am talking directly to the reader. I won't do this often because I want to tell you to please pay attention. I know that when I read, things kind of run into each other and my attention gets diluted a little bit. I get it. It happens. I'll use this "voice" only, and respectfully, when I'm want to say OK, I still love you but you were asleep, that's OK, please be awake now, the next bit will "count".
```

In a run-on sentence, `I'll talk to you directly like this`. See? They're supposed to look the same visually, so you can tell, and, not be confused about what I'm trying to do.

---

Now, where were we. Right. I was going to ask you to do some things for me. Just, one human to another. This is what they are:

 - leave your belief system behind. I know, that you don't "know" anything about the things we call "belief". 
 - All this religion, all this "but everyone knows that's true" stuff, just don't. Only for as long as you want, as long as I have your respect. Just humour me, and don't pretend you know things that you don't know. You can decide which is which. Human man to whatever-you-identify-as, just don't pretend to yourself that you know things that you don't know.
 
## How many hands to you have? 

See?!

That's what *knowing* feels like. You *know* how many hands you have. Nobody has to tell you. You *know*.

Now

## What happened before the Big Bang? (what happened before there was anything?) Before this, what was true?

See?!

That's what *belief* feels like.

If you are a member of one of the Abrahamic faiths then your cenception of heaven is based on *belief*, and not *knowledge*. 

Belief and Knowing feel differently in your head. Experiment with this. You can do it. You can tell the difference between what *belief* feels like to you and what *knowing* feels like to you.

I *believe* that you will do these things with me. I *know* that you can.

```

So. To ask my question again. To drive the point home. While you are reading this, don't confuse knowing with believing, please. I respect both in you. You are free to decide what you put in the one category or what you put in the other category. I don't care about what you decide. I care to ask you to be *believe* me that they are different and for you to *know* the difference.

My story will only be worth your while if you can do this for me, so that's why I'm being humble about this with you. I would like to have your attention for a bit, because I have my reasons and I'll explain them to you if you want, but, for this to be worth anything to you, you'll have to know the difference between belief and knowledge.

Ok and lastly.

I am not here to judge you. Not you individually. I love you, you are as a part of myself. I love you like I love my finger. I would rather have you, as a fellow, than not. This is my entire agenda. Not to judge, not to instruct, not to teach, not to find fault, criticize you or any other being you know individually. `I am really still talking to you. I say these things without irony or sarcasm`.

Let's just look at some things together, please?
