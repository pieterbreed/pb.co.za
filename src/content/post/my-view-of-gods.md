Or, Why I think that some ancestral (genetic) nations shared similar books of knowledge, and how you can tell in modern culture

And, Why each of these ancestral nations, even when they had the same knowledge, maintained it with different degrees of care

Some nations were just "better" at maintaining their ancestral knowledge than others were. But a lot of us started out with the same body of knowledge, as given by how similar our mythologies are to each other.

Imagine an original "book". A collection of facts that was painstakingly told from one person to the next, father to son, mother to daughter, shaman to acolyte, one generation down into the next. This. This wisdom that we as a species learned how to retain by sheer force of memory, this is our heritage. And we all have it.

Out of the Savanahs on the original continent humans came from, there was one tribe, stronger than the others, that survived where other, similar tribes did not. We survived because we *remembered*. We learnt how to record facts (originally just by realizing that we can remember them within one lifetime) and then later, we realized that we could remember for longer than one lifetime, but telling somebody else what we knew. By "teaching" them what we knew.

Our tribe, mastered this skill. Generation after generation after generation, our ancestors figured out how to memorize stuff verbally, large, large bodies of information, just memorized over entire lifetimes of study.

Then we figured out how to write shit down, because, you can get to a point where no single human being can remember everything that has to be remembered anymore. You have a capacity size issue and you, as a human, capable of finding solutions to problems, figure out that writing shit down is the way to go. You can massively increase your tribe's bandwidth if you write shit down into books. This is such a useful skill, that we invent it and forget it a couple of times. In multiple times and places on the planet, humanity figures out how to record shit in a format such that he doesn't have to do the hard work of having to memorize all of that shit each and every time. (The first engineer is born)

Humankind figures out how to solve problems (Engineers)

Humankind figures out a concept of health. People get sick. You can cure them or make them better. You can improve the human experience is an obvious invention. It's an idea.

But back while we were still remembering shit, back then, we recorded only our most vital, most important shit. Because memorizing shit is hard work, yo! So we take care to only record things that we think is "important". But importance is an individual judgement-call. And you know and I know that your judgements and mine are different. You judge different things and situations differently from how I judge the same things and the same situations.

Anyway - knowing how to discriminate is important, because homankind collectsio SHITTONS of information, memoriing everything is impossible, so we pick and choose what we memorize.

I present to you, the earliest body of work that it seems most of my European ancestry remembers. That of the Gods of Abraham, Rome, Greece. Those of the Norsemen and the Pharoahs. And finally, even the Buddhist cast and those of the Hindi, those brown people behind the Kush mountains.

If you look at those gods carefully enough, you'll see they are looking very, very, very and eerily similar. Like something's up man. Coincidence? I think not!

Imagine one of your ancestors, like your mother or your father's mother or father and so on up and up and up the chain. Like your own personal great-great-great-great-and-so-on-grandmother-or-father. 

I am telling you, that one of your uber-ancestors, lived in a tribe of humans at a time when there was only one single tribe of humans anywhere in the world. One, tiny little tribe. That's all that was left of us. Some calamity had happened. Shit got real for a while. And one little social circle of people survived all of that hardship.

One tribe. One village. One city. One shelter. One something with a few small number of humans in it and those were the only humans on the planet!

That happened. At least twice. If you know where to look, you will find records of this. One of those is by looking straight at the machinery of how our machines work, genetics. If you study genetics carefully enough, you learn to recognise that we all share a small number of ancestors. You can tell where people are from in the world by looking at their blood.

It's written in a font so tiny that you can't see it with the naked eye. But it's there, in every single cell in your body. If you look closely enough, you too, can learn to read your genetics and you too, will be able to tell this same thing. We all share a small number of great-great-great-great-great-and-so-on-grand-father-or-mother.

At some point in our history, we were all related and we were the same people. And there were very little of us. But we won. We fucking made it! Congratulations man! You belong to a species of winners! You're amazing and I love you!







We all, subsequent to receiving the  



 - zeus (greek) and _whathisname_ (roman) are as God (Yahweh)
 - Hercules (greek) and _whatshisname_ (roman) are to Zeus and _whatshisname_ is like Abraham is to Yahweh.
 - Satan is as Hades and Yama (Tibetan "king of the underworld, judge of the dead")
 - Maria, the mother of God. Like Hera and _whatshername_
 
What about the other Greek mythological creatures?

 - The cyclops
 - What about the Norsemen?
