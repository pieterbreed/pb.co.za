Or, Why I think that some ancestral (genetic) nations shared similar books of knowledge, and how you can tell in modern culture

And, Why each of these ancestral nations, even when they had the same knowledge, maintained it with different degrees of care

Some nations were just "better" at maintaining their ancestral knowledge than others were. But a lot of us started out with the same body of knowledge, as given by how similar our mythologies are to each other.

Imagine an original "book". A collection of facts that was painstakingly told from one person to the next, father to son, mother to daughter, shaman to acolyte, one generation down into the next. This. This wisdom that we as a species learned how to retain by sheer force of memory, this is our heritage. And we all have it.

Out of the Savanahs on the original continent humans came from, there was one tribe, stronger than the others, that survived where other, similar tribes did not. We survived because we *remembered*. We learnt how to record facts (originally just by realizing that we can remember them within one lifetime) and then later, we realized that we could remember for longer than one lifetime, but telling somebody else what we knew. By "teaching" them what we knew.

Our tribe, mastered this skill. Generation after generation after generation, our ancestors figured out how to memorize stuff verbally, large, large bodies of information, just memorized over entire lifetimes of study.

Then we figured out how to write shit down, because, you can get to a point where no single human being can remember everything that has to be remembered anymore. You have a capacity size issue and you, as a human, capable of finding solutions to problems, figure out that writing shit down is the way to go. You can massively increase your tribe's bandwidth if you write shit down into books. This is such a useful skill, that we invent it and forget it a couple of times. In multiple times and places on the planet, humanity figures out how to record shit in a format such that he doesn't have to do the hard work of having to memorize all of that shit each and every time. (The first engineer is born)

Humankind figures out how to solve problems (Engineers)

Humankind figures out a concept of health. People get sick. You can cure them or make them better. You can improve the human experience is an obvious invention. It's an idea.

But back while we were still remembering shit, back then, we recorded only our most vital, most important shit. Because memorizing shit is hard work, yo! So we take care to only record things that we think is "important". But importance is an individual judgement-call. And you know and I know that your judgements and mine are different. You judge different things and situations differently from how I judge the same things and the same situations.

Anyway - knowing how to discriminate is important, because homankind collectsio SHITTONS of information, memoriing everything is impossible, so we pick and choose what we memorize.

I present to you, the earliest body of work that it seems most of my European ancestry remembers. That of the Gods of Abraham, Rome, Greece. Those of the Norsemen and the Pharoahs. And finally, even the Buddhist cast and those of the Hindi, those brown people behind the Kush mountains.

If you look at those gods carefully enough, you'll see they are looking very, very, very and eerily similar. Like something's up man. Coincidence? I think not!

Imagine one of your ancestors, like your mother or your father's mother or father and so on up and up and up the chain. Like your own personal great-great-great-great-and-so-on-grandmother-or-father. 

I am telling you, that one of your uber-ancestors, lived in a tribe of humans at a time when there was only one single tribe of humans anywhere in the world. One, tiny little tribe. That's all that was left of us. Some calamity had happened. Shit got real for a while. And one little social circle of people survived all of that hardship.

One tribe. One village. One city. One shelter. One something with a few small number of humans in it and those were the only humans on the planet!

That happened. At least twice. If you know where to look, you will find records of this. One of those is by looking straight at the machinery of how our machines work, genetics. If you study genetics carefully enough, you learn to recognise that we all share a small number of ancestors. You can tell where people are from in the world by looking at their blood.

It's written in a font so tiny that you can't see it with the naked eye. But it's there, in every single cell in your body. If you look closely enough, you too, can learn to read your genetics and you too, will be able to tell this same thing. We all share a small number of great-great-great-great-great-and-so-on-grand-father-or-mother.

At some point in our history, we were all related and we were the same people. And there were very little of us. But we won. We fucking made it! Congratulations man! You belong to a species of winners! You're amazing and I love you!

At that time, we had invented a few technologies already:

 - we knew how to remember things (we had a history)
 - we had made some basic observations about the nature of reality, eg we all start out the same way and end the same way (birth and death). We invent the concept of mortality, ie, your life has an end.
 - we knew how to teach others things. We used memory to learn things, but we had to be taught, verbally, what those things were.
 - We knew how to sit still, concentrate for long stretches of time and memorize shit
 - Recognise that in order to do this, you would also have been safe from normal predation, so we know that by this time, we knew how to tame the world around us to some extent. IE, we had figured out that we had an effect on the world. We could change stuff. We could build houses (permanent dwellings, where we chose them). We could make ourselves safe, long enough for one or two of us to sit, day after day after day just learning shit by listening to stories, all the goddamn time.
 
 Every culture has them. Shamans. Witchdoctors, druids, magicians, jedi, priests and so on. Men who "knew scary shit". Their knowledge made them powerful, people were in awe of them because of "what they knew". And all of those people figured out that teaching is a special part of such a life. You had to not just know these things, but you also had to know how to teach others these things. Well. You had to teach them these things well enough that they would be able to teach the next kid. Well enough to remember. Well enough that they could teach the next kid how to remember and so on.
 
 These people were humanity's libraries. They literally knew everything that mankind had been able to figure out and retain about itself.
 
 And at some point, we figure out how to write shit down so we could remember more things.
 
 So think about if you were in that position. Imagine yourself. You have just invented writing. Congratulations! Now, what do you do with writing? What do you write down first?
 
 It seems as if the first people didn't invent writing at the same time as they invented paper. The earliest writing we know of, would have taken a hell of a long time to actually write. Imagine this was you. You weren't holding a pen or a pencel, you were holding something heavy and hard. Like maybe a special stick, a little bit like a spear. With this, you could scratch on shit and leave marks.
 
 Have you every done this? taken your finger or a stick or a piece of metal wire or something and just scratched at rocks and other various shit. Pavement and what not. Have you noticed that you could make marks on those things that were hard to make, but also kindof hard to erase too. Like if you scratch long enough at a rock, you can make grooves in it. But if those grooves are microscopically shallow (literally only faint lines on the rock's surface)... then surprise, if you rub the rock long enough, those marks go out. They're buffed out, as it were.
 
 So if you want to write something down, that has to be readable in 5 minutes, and all you have is a hard thing and a rock, then you are safe if you make shalow scratches on the rock.
 
 If you had to make marks that could survive a day. You had to really fucking work at that rock and scratch it good, so you won't depend on where the powder falls to see where you scratched, but you would be able to feel the groove with your finger, he following day.
 
 We're talking about some amount of owork here.
 
 Now imagine you were trying to write shit down in such a way that you could remember more things. All of your acolytes were constantly engaged only in one thing, memorizing shit. They were busy with this all the time and yet, there were more information to remember still. Right? We have a bandwith problem, remember, and we can use writing so increase our bandwidth a little bit.
 
 What do you write down?
 
 I guess it's your most important legend. Your story that means the most. The one of where you came from. The story about how you come to be where you are.
 
 Along the way, somebody figure out, if he tells you story about how you were born, it makes you more likely to survive. So this corpus of knowledeg, "where am i from" is our most important body of knowledge. We all have them. Myths and legends that disappear into our history.
 
 Men who climbed down from the heavens to earth on a magic ladder. Gods sitting on huge mountains. Burning bushes. Before that we have light and darkness that gets separated. We get taught early on that things can be light or dark, good or bad. That there is a duality to existence. What comes from one end gets destroyed on the other end. The yin and the yang.
 
 God and Satan.
 
 Zeus and Hades.
 
 The Pharoahs in Egypt.
 
 This is the first thing we right down because we recognise it as our most treasured piece of knowledge. We can't write everything down yet, writing is still too hard. But we can write down a small number of things. Our most important legends that help us the most to survive. We record our gods first.
 
 All the children of that tribe had access to this knowledge. As members of that shelter, they all had the benefit of this thinking. At some point, things got better and we had our first new population explosion. We decided to kick some people out. A group of friends and family members manded together and se of to go and find another shelter for themselves. Another permanent dwelling. The second antique city.
 
 The got the book though. Just remember that. They got the book, because the people who knew our shit back then realized that more of us would make it if more of us had the knowledge of how to survive.
 
 We all started out, with the same book of Knowledge.
 
 
 
 

 - zeus (greek) and _whathisname_ (roman) are as God (Yahweh)
 - Hercules (greek) and _whatshisname_ (roman) are to Zeus and _whatshisname_ is like Abraham is to Yahweh.
 - Satan is as Hades and Yama (Tibetan "king of the underworld, judge of the dead")
 - Maria, the mother of God. Like Hera and _whatshername_
 
What about the other Greek mythological creatures?

 - The cyclops
 - What about the Norsemen?
